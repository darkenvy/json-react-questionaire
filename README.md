# JSON Questionnaire Builder in React

This project was built using "react-boilerplate" for it's quick startup time with weback.

To start, run `npn install` then `npm start`.

I developed this app on node version 14, so if you have issues, install node 14 using nvm.

`app/containers/index.js` is the entrypoint of interest (where the majority of work was done by me).
